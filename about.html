      <p><span style="font-family: Comfortaa, Verdana;">You might want to know a
          bit about this website and why it was created. Here's the info you are
          looking for:</span></p>
      <h2><span style="font-family: Comfortaa, Verdana;">The start of
          codingkid.ninja</span></h2>
      <p>codingkid.ninja originally started out as a blog-format website at
        codingkid.weebly.com. (It still exists, under "old site" in menu bar) I
        found it time-consuming to write posts for it, so it was not updated
        much. I decided to move away from using Weebly because I would have to
        pay to hook up my domain name, and because of the lack of customization
        (compared to just writing HTML). Back when I used the Weebly site,
        codingkid.ninja redirected to codingkid.weebly.com. I eventually
        realized that I could use Github Pages with my domain name, so I started
        on my new website. The first prototype was bad; just a plain white page
        with the "Purisa" font. No pictures. Eventually, I got to this. </p>
      <h2>How I built it</h2>
      <p>I use Github Pages to host this site, which is licensed under MIT
        license. I was able to hook up my name.com domain name to the site,
        allowing the page to seem like any other (but hosted by Github). I build
        the site with BlueGriffon, but code most of it manually. I use Inkscape
        for the images. I have used several online tutorials and StackExchange
        questions to help me with the perplexing world of website building. </p>
      <h2>Look Ma, no ads!</h2>
      <p>You may have noticed that this site has no ads. I don't like ads, and
        always use an adblocker (and Privacy Badger, Noscript). I think that it
        is pointless to add ads if no one will ever click on them. I also find
        them intrusive and annoying. </p>
      <h2>But what about the ad for MOO.com?</h2>
      <p>That is just me recommending them. I choose to put it on my site. Full
        disclosure: I do get $15 off an order when you use my link to buy
        things. The recommendation is not intrusive, so I believe that it is OK
        to have on my site. </p>
      <h2>Privacy Policy (in plain English)</h2>
      <p>In short, I will never track you. I believe that tracking is bad. The
        only cookies that this site will leave are from the theme changer, so it
        can remember what theme you used previously. This feature hasn't been
        implemented yet, so for now, this website is cookie-free! I may someday
        add a system that logs how many visitors I get. This would not collect
        any information identifying you, it would only add one to a counter, and
        maybe leave a cookie so you are not counted twice. </p>
      <h2>Who am I?</h2>
      <p>I go by Merlin04 on some sites, and codingkid.ninja on others. I prefer
        to remain anonymous. I can tell you that I am a kid who likes coding and
        making things. My favorite language is Python, as you could probably
        tell from the background. I am not a big fan of JavaScript, although I
        admit that I haven't done much with it. I definitely don't like Java. </p>
      <h2>How do I make money from this site?</h2>
      <p>I don<span style="font-family: Comfortaa, Verdana;"></span><span style="font-family: Comfortaa,Verdana;">'t.
          I pay ~$20 a year for the domain. Someday I will get a Patreon page,
          so you can give money to me. :-)</span></p>
