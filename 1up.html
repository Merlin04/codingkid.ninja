      <h2><span> Review of the 1UP Keyboards DIY No-Solder USB Cable Kit</span></h2>
      <p>When I found out about the 1UP Keyboards cable kit, I was intrigued. It
        is supposed to let you create a cable of any color, length, or type that
        fits your keyboard perfectly. The one thing that deterred me from buying
        it, however, was the price tag - $14 for a 3 foot cable! Luckily, I was
        able to get a sample from 1UP Keyboards at no charge so I could write
        this review and tell you if it is worth it. Don't worry, this will not
        bias my review in any way, as you will see.&nbsp;</p>
      <p>Here's the cable kit:</p>
      <img style="width: 867px; height: 487px;" title="Cable Kit" alt="Cable Kit package"
        src="1up-pics/package.jpeg"><br>
      Inside are all of the parts - the USB plug parts, the cable, the paracord,
      the techflex (if you chose to get it), and the heatshrink. The parts seem
      high quality. <br>
      <img style="width: 867px; height: 487px;" title="Insides of bag" alt="Insides of bag"
        src="1up-pics/insides.jpg"><br>
      Now, time to assemble them! There is an online video on how to do this,
      and I am following it. The first thing you do is erase the writing off of
      the heatshrink. I am not sure why they don't just give you heatshrink that
      doesn't come with writing on it. <br>
      <img style="width: 867px; height: 487px; transform: rotate(180deg);" title="Erasing"
        alt="Erasing the heatshrink writing" src="1up-pics/erase.jpg"><br>
      This produced a lot of eraser crumbs. <br>
      After that, I needed to pull the string out of the paracord so the cable
      can fit inside it.<br>

        alt="Pulling string out of paracord. " src="1up-pics/paracord.jpg"><br>
      The next step is to put the USB plug on the cable. This is the no-solder
      kit, so that is very easy. Just line up the wires inside the USB part and
      snap the green part down. <br>
      <img style="width: 867px; height: 487px;" title="USB plug" alt="USB plug attached on the cable"
        src="1up-pics/USB.jpg"><br>
      After that came the hardest part. I needed to push the cable through the
      paracord. It was very very tight, and took hours of time to get it just
      halfway through. The first few times I tried, the cable's exposed wires
      got stuck on the cable. I tried what 1UP recommended - putting tape on the
      cable end - but the tape just fell off. Eventually, I tried cutting off
      the end of the cable, but it got stuck in the middle and wouldn't budge.
      The time I worked on this step was around 6 hours (I did get help from
      others, this figure includes their time). I never was able to get the
      paracord on the cable. Luckily, I got techflex to put over the paracord,
      and I was able to use that instead of the paracord, but the cable is not
      blue like I intended it to be, it is grey. <br>
      After this, I continued with the video tutorial. Unfortunately, I don't
      have pictures of this process, but it went according to the video. I only
      ran into one problem with the heatshrink, but that was my fault. I kept
      the heat gun still for a moment, melting the techflex. I needed to use a
      new piece of heatshrink to cover up the hole. <br>
      Here's the completed cable:<br>

      <br>
      So, what do I think of this cable kit? Here's the pros and cons, as well
      as my final rating. <br>
      <h2>Pros</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;- No soldering necessary</p>
      <p>&nbsp;- You get a high quality cable in the end</p>
      <h2>Cons</h2>
      <p>&nbsp;- Very easy to melt the techflex when putting on the heatshrink</p>
      <p>&nbsp;- Very very very hard, if not impossible, to install the paracord</p>
      <h2>Final Rating</h2>
      <p>I rate this cable kit 2 stars out of 5. It is very hard, if not
        impossible, to get the final product. However, the cable is still high
        quality. If you still want to buy one, <a title="1UP Keyboards" href="https://1upkeyboards.com/diy-no-solder-usb-cable-kit-2.html">click
