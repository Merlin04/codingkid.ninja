      <h2>$5 filament!</h2>
      <p>My trusty spool of Hatchbox ABS was running out. On the hunt for new
        filament, I found ProtoParadigm, a US-based filament maker. They have an
        interesting product line - "$5 Filament - 3D printing on pocket change".
        I decided to start reviewing things on my website. I asked them if I
        could have some filament in exchange for a review. I did not pay for the
        filament, but this will be an unbiased review, I promise. </p>
      <p>First of all, here's what ProtoParadigm sent me:</p>
      <img style="width: 527px; height: 297px;" title="Filament unbagged" alt="Filament is on table"
        src="5filament-pics/pic1.jpg"><br>
      I got two spools of ProSpec PLA, "Emerald" and "Citrine". They look quite
      nice, but the camera I used (my phone) does not capture the true color of
      the filament. Look on ProtoParadigm's website for the color. Each spool
      has a label on it, reading:<br>
      [Filament Color]<br>
      ProSpec PLA<br>
      1.75mm - 200g<br>
      Unspooling Tips:<br>
      http://bit.ly/1Mgv1FU<br>
      <br>
      The spools seem a bit flimsy. They should work...<br>
      On to the printer!<br>
      <br>
      ProtoParadigm had told me to print it at 230 degrees C. Here it is loaded
      on the printer (Monoprice Maker Select/Wanhao Di3):<br>
      <br>
      <img style="width: 527px; height: 297px;" title="Filament on the printer"
        alt="The $5 filament, loaded onto the 3d printer" src="5filament-pics/pic2.jpg"><br>
      I decided to first print a dinosaur ("Robber Rex", also seen on 3d
      Printing Nerd's "Exotic Filament Dinosaurs" video). I used MatterControl
      to slice it. It didn't work...<br>
      <br>
      <img style="width: 527px; height: 297px;" title="It was fuzzy when it came off the printer. "
        alt="A failed dinosaur 3d print. It was fuzzy when it came off of the printer. "
        src="5filament-pics/pic3.jpg"><br>
      The filament got caught on the spokes of the spool. Seems that the spool
      doesn't work as well as I thought it would. I looked at the link on the
      label, and behold! Instructions to fix the spool! ProtoParadigm calls the
      mod a "Filament Flange": take a piece of filament and thread it through
      the holes on the spokes. That worked great! It would be nice if
      ProtoParadigm would have the spools come with the fix pre-installed. Next
      print: a "Maker Coin".<br>
      <br>
      <img style="width: 527px; height: 297px;" title="Maker coins are makery. "
        alt="A maker coin I printed. " src="5filament-pics/pic4.jpg"><br>
      Now it seems like my camera was able to get the color of the filament
      right. The print turned out awesome. However, the top of the "n" had some
      strings. Also, the priming MatterControl generates is hard to remove. This
      may be do to the filament being stronger than other filaments.<br>
      <h2>Overall Judgement</h2>
      <p>I rate $5 Filament ProSpec PLA four stars out of five. Here's why:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;- Being able to buy many colors of filament instead of one spool
        of the same color is awesome. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;- The filament prints nicely and is strong. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;- The "Filament Flange" that I needed was a bit hard to find:
        "Unspooling" does not describe my problem. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;- The "Filament Flange" should come with the spool. I understand
        it is not necessary for all printers, but I wasted filament discovering
        that I need it.</p>
      <p><br>
        Would I buy it myself? Yes. It is good filament at a good price. I like
        the color variety. Now that I know that I need the modification, I won't
        waste plastic. </p>
      <p>Thanks to ProtoParadigm for sending me this filament. </p>
