    <p>codingkid.ninja v2.0</p>
    <p>I have been trying to make the codingkid.ninja website look better. After
      lots of work, I have come up with what you see here. Here is what changed:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Changed "Stuff" to "<a href="stuff.html">Projects</a>"</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Created logo</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Added new menu bar</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ WIP: theme changer</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ "Updates" and "Portal" are no longer iframes, and are now in
      columns. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Revised description of site</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Added carousel</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Created a shared CSS file</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Added a "View past updates" button in the "Updates" column.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Created "<a href="about.html">About website</a>" page<br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;- Less mobile friendly, solution (hopefully) coming soon. </p>
    <p>Internal changes:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Created new local folder for the website with no unneeded files</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ I got much better at CSS</p>
