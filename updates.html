    <p>codingkid.ninja v2.6<br>
      <br>
      I changed a few things. <br>
      <br>
      &nbsp;+ Added Patreon link and banner<br>
      &nbsp;+ Added "games" section to home page<br>
      &nbsp;+ Added <a href="microbit.html">review of BBC micro:bit</a><br>
      &nbsp;- Removed net neutrality notice, "day of action" pop-up<br>
      &nbsp;- Removed "theme changer coming soon" from bottom of the screen</p>
    <hr>codingkid.ninja v2.5
    <p>Added net neutrality notice. </p>
    <p> 6-15-17</p>
    <h2></h2>
    <hr>codingkid.ninja v2.4
    <p>Skipped 2.3 because this is a (semi-) big release. </p>
    <p>I added a "<a title="Reviews" href="reviews.html">Reviews</a>" section. I
      put it in Projects and in the title bar, and I updated the CSS file to
      account for a wider menu. I also removed the "work in progress" notice on
      the home page. I might have changed a few things that I don't remember,
      check the <a title="codingkid.ninja Github" href="https://github.com/merlin04/codingkid.ninja">codingkid.ninja
        Github page</a>. <br>

    <p>codingkid.ninja v2.1 </p>
    <p>Just a day after v2.0, I have another update! Here's what changed:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Responsive design</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Mobile device friendly</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Updates page now uses shared CSS file</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Fixed a typo in previous update</p>
    <p>The new mobile view uses tutorial code from sitepoint.com. They are
      awesome!</p>
    <p>If you didn't get a chance to read the v2.0 update log, click "<a href="file:///home/benjamin/codingkid-bluegriffon-2.0/updates.html">View
        past updates</a>", also at the bottom of the updates sidebar.&nbsp;</p>

    <hr>codingkid.ninja v2.0
    <p>I have been trying to make the codingkid.ninja website look better. After
      lots of work, I have come up with what you see here. Here is what changed:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Changed "Stuff" to "<a href="stuff.html">Projects</a>"</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Created logo</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Added new menu bar</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ WIP: theme changer</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ "Updates" and "Portal" are no longer iframes, and are now in
      columns. </p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Revised description of site</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Added carousel</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Created a shared CSS file</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Added a "View past updates" button in the "Updates" column.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Created "<a href="about.html">About website</a>" page<br>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;- Less mobile friendly, solution (hopefully) coming soon. </p>
    <p>Internal changes:</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ Created new local folder for the website with no unneeded files</p>
    <p>&nbsp;+ I got much better at CSS</p>
