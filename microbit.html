      <h2><span>BBC micro:bit - is it just for education?</span></h2>
      <p>In 2015, the BBC (British Broadcasting Corporation) gave away a
        development board called the BBC micro:bit (named after the BBC Micro)
        to every Year 7 (11-12 year old) student. The goal was to try to <a href="https://arstechnica.co.uk/gadgets/2015/07/bbc-microbit-a-free-single-board-pc-for-every-year-7-kid-in-the-uk/">"encourage&nbsp;kids
          to learn how computers work, rather than simply consuming media on
          them."</a> I do not live in the UK, so I did not get one. However,
        they are now being sold commercially. The $15 dollar board has a bunch
        of goodies packed in, including Bluetooth, a 5*5 led matrix, two
        buttons, an accelerometer, and more! But is it any good? Let's find out!</p>
      <img style="width: 884px; height: 497px;" title="micro:bit box front" alt="micro:bit box front"

      <img style="width: 884px; height: 497px;" title="micro:bit box back" alt="micro:bit box back"
        src="microbit-pics/box-back.jpg"><br>
      <p>The box does not give much information as to what's inside. It does say
        that a portion of the sales from the micro:bit goes to the Micro:bit
        Educational Foundation. Let's open the box!</p>
      <img style="width: 884px; height: 497px;" title="Inside of box" alt="Inside of box"
        src="microbit-pics/inside.jpg"><br>
      <br>
      Inside there is a quick start guide, a "safety guide" which is not very
      helpful, and the board itself, packaged in a very strange anti-static bag.
      <br>
      <br>
      <img style="width: 884px; height: 497px;" title="The micro:bit itself!" alt="The micro:bit itself!"
        src="microbit-pics/microbit.jpg"><br>
      <br>
      Here's the micro:bit itself! It is quite small. Here it is next to a
      Raspberry Pi Zero in a case:<br>
      <br>

        src="microbit-pics/compare.jpg"><br>
      <br>
      The micro:bit has a Micro USB connector. When I plug it in to my computer,
      it powers on and runs a demo program showcasing the hardware. The LEDs are
      bright!<br>
      <br>
      <img style="width: 884px; height: 497px;" title="TOO BRIGHT!" alt="TOO BRIGHT!"
        src="microbit-pics/leds.jpg"><br>
      <br>
      The demo program is only interesting for a minute or two. Time to try
      programming it!<br>
      The quick start guide tells me to go to the website "microbitworld.me". I
      try going there, but it seems to not exist anymore. I was able to find
      microbit.org. It seemed relatively straightforward to program, it used
      MicroPython or a block-based Javascript Microsoft made. I decided to try
      Python first. I was easily able to make text scroll across the screen. I
      also tried the Microsoft language. I built a sound-effects machine by
      connecting my headphones to the alligator clip terminals on the board.
      When it came time to upload my code, all I had to do was download a .hex
      file and put it onto the micro:bit's internal storage (it shows up as a
      flash drive). <br>
      <br>
      I had previously made a program for my Pyboard, which also runs
      Micropython, called iSec (different from iSec Capture), which is a
      miniature security system featuring a code that would need to be entered
      to stop an alarm. A page on the iSec is (hopefully) coming soon! I was
      excited to try to port this to the micro:bit, which uses a slightly
      different syntax for accessing pins. But how could I put the micro:bit
      into a breadboard?<br>
      <br>
      <img style="width: 665px; height: 715px;" title="Sparkfun breakout board. "
        alt="Sparkfun breakout board. " src="microbit-pics/breakout.jpg"><br>
      <br>
      Enter the Sparkfun micro:bit breakout board ($5)! This plugs into the
      bottom of the micro:bit and gives you a place to solder header pins. Some
      people would be upset at having to use a breakout board, but I like the
      idea. If I have multiple circuits that use the micro:bit, I can unplug the
      micro:bit from one and plug it into another. <br>
      <br>
      The final feature I want to cover didn't work for me. It was the micro:bit
      app. The micro:bit has Bluetooth connectivity, which should allow one to
      flash the board from their phone. Since the software development is all
      done online, you should not need a computer to program it. However, I was
      not able to get the micro:bit to pair. I am not sure if this affects the
      "radio", which allows two micro:bits to talk to each other. I am not that
      sad that this feature doesn't work, because I would never want to code it
      from my phone anyway. I would prefer a real keyboard. <br>
      <h2>Overall Judgement</h2>
      <p>I rate the BBC micro:bit 5 stars out of 5. Here's why:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;- The board is very easy to use, and the programming languages
        are very well supported. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;- The breakout may be a pain for some people, but it allows the
        micro:bit to be swapped between different circuits easily. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;- The built-in hardware allows one to get started as soon as they
        get the board. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;- The Bluetooth not working is not a problem for me, as I wasn't
        planning on using it anyway. </p>
      <p>&nbsp;- Even the board is targeted towards schools, it still is great
        for other people. </p>
      <p>Here's a comparison between Pyboard and micro:bit:</p>

      </table>
      <p>As you can see, the Pyboard is much more powerful than the micro:bit,
        but that comes at a price. It is twice as expensive as the micro:bit with
        the breakout board! Most projects don't need that much power, so I would
        recommend getting a micro:bit instead of a Pyboard if you want to try a
        board running MicroPython. <br>
