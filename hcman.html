      <h2>Review of Hcman Mechanical Gaming Keyboard Blue Switches,PC Gaming
        Keyboard of 6 Colors Led Backlit for Computer or Mac,87 Keys</h2>
      <p>Phew, that's a long title. Only one category of items could have a name
        as long as that - cheap Amazon stuff! I was able to find a mechanical
        keyboard for under $30. But at the amazing price of $25.99, is it any
        good? Let's find out! </p>
      <p>Before I start, I want to mention that I never planned to do a review
        of this, so I threw away the box and did not take pictures of it. I will
        be using some pictures from the product page. </p>
      <p>Here's a picture of the keyboard from the product page:</p>
      <img style="width: 886px; height: 321px;" title="Hcman keyboard" alt="Hcman keyboard"
        src="hcman-pics/ppage.jpg"><br>
      The product looks almost identical to that picture, with the one exception
      of the logo being shinier. Here's mine:<br>
      <img style="width: 892px; height: 303px;" title="My keyboard" alt="My keyboard - has different keycaps"
        src="hcman-pics/mine.jpg"><br>
      It looks a bit different! Recently, I went to the Seattle Mechanical
      Keyboards expo and won a set of GMK Terminal keycaps. Since I program,
      these keycaps are great for me! I decided to put them on my keyboard.
      However, they make the keyboard's clicking more high pitched, because they
      are a different material. <br>
      One interesting thing about this keyboard is that it has a colorful
      backlight, but is not RGB. Each row is a different color. This makes it
      look bad with my non-gamer keycaps, so I would want to turn the backlight
      off entirely. <br>
      <img style="width: 892px; height: 305px;" title="Backlight on" alt="Backlight on - :-("
        src="hcman-pics/blon.jpg"><br>
      Unfortunately, I cannot disable the Windows key LED without disabling the
      functionality the key would normally provide. <br>
      <h2>More details + Overall Judgement</h2>
      I rate the Hcman mechanical keyboard 3 stars out of 5. Here are the pros
      of this keyboard:<br>
      &nbsp;- This is one of the cheapest mechanical keyboards you can buy, and
      it works. I would rather have this than a $50 rubber dome keyboard. <br>
      &nbsp;- This has PBT keycaps. The key legends will not wear out for a long
      time. <br>
      &nbsp;- It has an aluminum plate, which looks nice. <br>
      &nbsp;- It has a braided cable, which is durable. <br>
      Here are the cons:<br>
      &nbsp;- There is a big ugly "Hcman" logo. It is shiny and distracting, and
      takes away from the professional feel. <br>
      &nbsp;- You can't turn off the Windows key's LED without disabling the
      key's functionality. <br>
      &nbsp;- I don't like the rainbow LED pattern.<br>
      &nbsp;- I feel like this is marketed too much towards gamers. This is a
      blue switch keyboard - not many gamers would use it. It is better for
      typing. I would prefer the original keycaps to have a regular font. <br>
      <br>
      I would recommend this to anyone who wants a mechanical keyboard, but
      cannot pay for an expensive one. I would not recommend this to people who
      can afford a better one, as there are much better ones that have more
      features. </div>
